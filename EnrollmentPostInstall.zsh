# Post Install script for a PreStage Enrollment Package

# and Setup Your Mac (https://snelson.us/sym)

# Optionally replace the value of this variable with the name of your organization.
organizationIdentifier=xyz.techitout

# After Setup Assistant exits, if jamf enrollment isn't complete,
# this is how many seconds to wait complete before exiting with an error:
enrollmentTimeout=120

# This postinstall script creates the following:
# A LaunchDaemon that starts a separate script to run a Jamf Pro policy command
# A LaunchAgent that runs Setup Your Mac soon as the first user logs in
# A script to wait for Jamf Pro enrollment to complete 
# - then triggers a Jamf Pro policy that triggers swiftDialog
# A script that is designed to be called by a Jamf Pro policy 
# - to unload the LaunchDaemon then remove the LaunchDaemon and script
#
# Q: Why not just call the `jamf policy -event` command 
#    from the PreStage Enrollment package postinstall script?
# A: Because the PreStage Enrollment package is installed
#    before the jamf binary is installed.
#
# Q: Why not just have the postinstall script wait until jamf enrollment is complete?
# A: Because the postinstall script won't exit while it waits, which prevents enrollment
#
# Q: Why not just include the Setup-Your-Mac-via-Dialog.bash script in the PreStage Enrollment package?
# A: Because every time you update it, for instance policyJSON, 
#    you'd need to re-build and re-upload the package
#
# Q: Why not distribute the extra scripts and LaunchDaemons somewhere else,
#    instead of embedding them in this funky postinstall script?
# A: This way you only have to download and maintain one extra thing.
# 
#
# One approach is to use the following locations and files:
# LaunchDaemon: 
#	/Library/LaunchDaemons/xyz.techitout.swiftDialog-prestarter.plist
#
# Temporary folder for the installer and scripts:
#	/usr/local/swiftDialogEnrollment/
#	
# Scripts:
#	/usr/local/swiftDialogEnrollment/xyz.techitout.swiftDialog-prestarter-installer.zsh
#	/usr/local/swiftDialogEnrollment/xyz.techitout.swiftDialog-prestarter-uninstaller.zsh
#
# The HEREDOC portions of this script that creates additional scripts
# uses the backslash character (\) to prevent commands from being run and
# to prevent variables from being interpreted.
# NOTE: Make sure to leave a full return at the end of HEREDOC 
# content before the last line that defines the end of the HEREDOC content.

# This script must be run as root or via Jamf Pro.
# The resulting Script and LaunchDaemon will be run as root.
#
